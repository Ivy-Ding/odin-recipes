## About

This project is created to practice and apply the HTML skills learnt from The Odin Project's [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) course. 

The outcome of this project was more experience writing HTML by hand, and an increased appreciation for static site generators and the feature of generating HTML from markdown.
